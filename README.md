Arduino sketch for 3-channel intervalometer

This is an Arduino sketch to implement a three-channel intervalometer for automated time-lapse photography.

The three camera channels can be set to fire simultaneously or after an adjustable delay.

Timing is set via a rotary encoder for simple single-knob control.
